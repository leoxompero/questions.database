question: |-
  Tables A, B have three columns (namely: ‘id’, ‘age’, ‘name’) each. These tables have no ‘null’ values and there are 100 records in each of the table.

  Here are two queries based on these two tables ‘A’ and ‘B’:

  Query1: SELECT A.id FROM A WHERE A.age > ALL (SELECT B.age FROM B WHERE B.name = 'Ankit')
  Query2: SELECT A.id FROM A WHERE A.age > ANY (SELECT B.age FROM B WHERE B.name = 'Ankit')

  Now, which of the following statement is correct for the output of each query?

answers:
  - The number of tuples in the output of Query 1 will be more than or equal to the output of Query 2
  - The number of tuples in the output of Query 1 will be equal to the output of Query 2
  - The number of tuples in the output Query 1 will be less than or equal to the output of Query 2
