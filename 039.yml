  Indexing is useful in a database for fast searching. Generally, B-tree is used for indexing in a database. Now, you want to use Binary Search Tree instead of B-tree.

  Suppose there are numbers between 1 and 100 and you want to search the number 35 using Binary Search Tree algorithm. Which of the following sequences CANNOT be the sequence for the numbers examined?

answers:
  - 10, 75, 64, 43, 60, 57, 55
  - 90, 12, 68, 34, 62, 45, 55
  - 9, 85, 47, 68, 43, 57, 55
  - 79, 14, 72, 56, 16, 53, 55
