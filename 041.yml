question: |-
  Suppose you have a csv file which has 3 columns (‘User_ID’, ‘Gender’, ‘Product_ID’) and 7,150,884 rows. You have created a table “train” from this file in SQL.

  Now, you run Query 1 as given below and get the following output:

  Query 1: EXPLAIN select * from train where Product_ID = 'P00370853';

  OUTPUT:

  QUERY PLAN
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Seq Scan on train (cost=0.00..79723.88 rows=16428 width=68)
  Filter: ((product_id)::text = 'P00370853'::text)
  (2 rows)

  You have now created Product_ID column as an index in train table using the below SQL query:

  CREATE INDEX product_ID ON train(Product_ID)

  And, you run Query 2 (same as Query 1) on “train” and get the following output.

  Query 2: EXPLAIN select * from train where Product_ID = 'P00370853';

  OUTPUT:

  QUERY PLAN
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bitmap Heap Scan on train (cost=829.53..40738.85 rows=35754 width=68)
  Recheck Cond: ((product_id)::text = 'P00370853'::text)
  -> Bitmap Index Scan on product_id (cost=0.00..820.59 rows=35754 width=0)
  Index Cond: ((product_id)::text = 'P00370853'::text)
  (4 rows)

  
  Which query will take less time to execute?
answers:
  - Query 1
  - Query 2
  - Both queries will take the same time
  - Can’t say
correct: B
