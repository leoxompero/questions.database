question: |-
  Suppose you are given a table/relation “EMPLOYEE” which has two columns (‘Name’ and ‘Salary’). The Salary column in this table has some NULL values. Now, I want to find out the records which have null values.
  
  Name   | Salary
  ---------------
  Saurav | NULL
  Ankit  | 1000
  Faizan | 2000
  Sunil  | 3000
  Kunal  | 4000


  What will be the output for the following queries?

  Query 1. SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Salary <> NULL;

  Query 2. SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Salary = NULL;

answers:
  - Query 1 will give last 4 rows as output (excluding null value)
  - Query 2 will give first row as output (only record containing null value)
  - Query 1 and Query 2 both will give the same result
