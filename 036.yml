  Courses (courseno: integer, cname: string)
  Registration (rollno: integer, courseno: integer, percent: real)

  Now, which of the following query would be able to find the unique names of all students having score more than 90% in the courseno 107?

answers:
  - SELECT DISTINCT S.sname FROM Students as S, Registration as R WHERE R.rollno=S.rollno AND R.courseno=107 AND R.percent >90
  - SELECT UNIQUE S.sname FROM Students as S, Registration as R WHERE R.rollno=S.rollno AND R.courseno=107 AND R.percent >90
  - SELECT sname FROM Students as S, Registration as R WHERE R.rollno=S.rollno AND R.courseno=107 AND R.percent >90
  - None of these

correct: A
