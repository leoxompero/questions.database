question: |-
  Suppose you have a CSV file which has 3 columns (‘User_ID’, ‘Gender’, ‘product_ID’) and 7150884 rows. You have created a table “train” from this file in SQL.

  Now, you run Query 1 (mentioned below):

  Query1: EXPLAIN SELECT * from train WHERE product_ID like '%7085%';

  Then, you created product_ID columns as an index in ‘train’ table using below SQL query:

  CREATE INDEX product_ID ON train(Product_ID)

  Suppose, you run Query 2 (same as Query 1) on train table.

  Query 2: EXPLAIN SELECT * from train WHERE product_ID like '%7085%';

  Let T1 and T2 be time taken by Query 1 and Query 2 respectively. Which query will take less time to execute?


answers:
  - T1>T2
  - T2>T1
  - T1~T2
